        <h1>
            Documentation and design notes for the ListView's occupancyMap object
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>
            The ListView control's <var>GridLayout</var> (Layouts.js) supports the
            concept of items, laid out together, that are of different sizes. This is known as
            <strong>variable-size layout</strong> and is implemented in the
            <var>VariableSizeDecorator</var> class. This type of layout is accomplished by defining a
            grid of slots that are of a fixed size. This dimension is specified by the
            application in the <var>groupInfo</var> property that it provides to the
            ListView constructor. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>

    <span class="keyword">var</span> listView = <span class="keyword">new</span> WinJS.UI.ListView(element, {
        layout: { <span class="fix">groupInfo: getGroupInfo</span>, ... },
        ...
    });

    <span class="keyword">function</span> getGroupInfo(groupItem) {
        <span class="comment">// cellWidth and cellHeight only honored in groups where enableCellSpanning: true</span>
        <span class="keyword">return</span> {
            enableCellSpanning: !groupItem || groupItem.data.enableCellSpanning,
            cellWidth: 88,
            cellHeight: 88
        };
    }
        </pre>
        <p>
            When the <var>groupInfo.enableCellSpanning</var> property has a value of <var class="keyword">true</var>, the group is
            capable of displaying variable-size items. It is at this point that an
            <strong>occupancy map</strong> is created for the group. The occupancy map's purpose
            is to track the allocation of slots to items -- that is, to map which items are
            displayed where on the slot grid. The occupancy map is also used to determine where
            the next item can be placed during the layout rendering process.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Population of the occupancy map
        </h2>
        <h3>Callstack</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
            <var>
                VariableSizeDecorator.markSlotAsFull<br />
                VariableSizeDecorator.addItemToMap<br />
                VariableSizeDecorator.ensureInMap<br />
                VariableSizeDecorator.calcItemPosition<br />
                GridLayout._calcItemPosition<br />
                GridLayout._layoutItem
            </var>
        </p>
        <p>
            When the <var>GridLayout</var> executes its <var>_layoutItem</var> function, it asks the group
            decorator to calculate the item's position via the <var>calcItemPosition</var> interface
            function. In the case of the <var>VariableSizeDecorator</var>, this code path leads to the
            <var>markSlotAsFull</var> function. This function contains the only line of code
            that actually modifies the <var>occupancyMap</var> object:
        </p>
        <pre>

    markSlotAsFull: <span class="keyword">function</span> (layout, index, itemEntry) {
        <span class="keyword">var</span> coordinates = layout._indexToCoordinate(index, <span class="keyword">this</span>.slotsPerColumn);
        <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">var</span> r = coordinates.row, toRow = coordinates.row + itemEntry.rows; r < toRow; r++) {
            <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">var</span> c = coordinates.column, toColumn = coordinates.column + itemEntry.columns; c < toColumn; c++) {
                <span class="fix"><span class="keyword">this</span>.occupancyMap[<span class="keyword">this</span>.coordinateToIndex(layout, c, r)] = itemEntry;</span>
            }
        }
    }
        </pre>
        <p>
            The <var>markSlotAsFull</var> function obtains the slot grid coordinates of the
            specified item's upper left corner, then iterates over each slot occupied by the
            item and writes a data object to the corresponding occupancyMap array entry. The
            occupancy map reads top-down, left-to-right.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Layout Example</h3>
        <p>
            The example below shows the variable-size slot grid with items of two different
            sizes laid out within it. The cellHeight and cellWidth in this example are 60px.
            The small items, A and C, are defined as 60x60 pixels, the same size as the
            slots. The large item, B, is 180x120 pixels. Note that there is just one item B,
            and it occupies six slots. The superscript values indicate the array index that
            corresponds to each slot. 
        </p>
        
        <table id="sampleMap">
            <tr>
                <td class="itemA">Item A<div>0</div></td>
                <td>&nbsp;<div>4</div></td>
                <td>&nbsp;<div>8</div></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="itemB">Item B<div>1</div></td>
                <td class="itemB">Item B<div>5</div></td>
                <td class="itemB">Item B<div>9</div></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="itemB">Item B<div>2</div></td>
                <td class="itemB">Item B<div>6</div></td>
                <td class="itemB">Item B<div>10</div></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="itemC">Item C<div>3</div></td>
                <td>&nbsp;<div>7</div></td>
                <td>&nbsp;<div>11</div></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            And here is the corresponding occupancy map array. Notice that there are four
            undefined array indexes &minus; [4], [7], [8], [11] &minus; because no item currently occupies those slots:
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 15px;">
            <var>
                [0] = { "Item A", index = 0, columns = 1, rows = 1 }<br />
                [1] = { "Item B", index = 1, columns = 3, rows = 2 }<br />
                [2] = { "Item B", index = 1, columns = 3, rows = 2 }<br />
                [3] = { "Item C", index = 2, columns = 1, rows = 1 }<br />
                [5] = { "Item B", index = 1, columns = 3, rows = 2 }<br />
                [6] = { "Item B", index = 1, columns = 3, rows = 2 }<br />
                [9] = { "Item B", index = 1, columns = 3, rows = 2 }<br />
                [10] = { "Item B", index = 1, columns = 3, rows = 2 }<br />
            </var>
        </p>


    <!--
    <p>
        Animations temporarily alter an object's current properties, and eventually return
        them to their original values. For example, an
        <var>
            enterPage</var>
        animation takes an element on the screen, temporarily offsets its position, then
        gradually animates the element back to its original position.
    </p>
    <p>
        The distinction between animations and transition is that animations could in theory
        all be removed from the application without any change to the logical behavior of
        the program. (The object still appears; it just doesn't look as pretty.) On the
        other hand, transitions represent state changes and would have to be replaced with
        some other way of changing the visual state. (The object needs to move from one
        place to another regardless.)
    </p>
    <p>
        From a programmatic standpoint, transitions and animations are very similar. For
        the purpose of this document, we will use the word <span class="term">action</span>
        to mean "transition or animation".

    <p>
        All of the properties are comma-separated lists, corresponding to respective actions.
        For example, to apply three actions to an element, set each of the properties to
        three values, separated by commas. Rules exist if one list is shorter than another;
        we will not take advantage of those rules, although we need to guard against the
        possibility that the host application may have.
    </p>
    <p>
        (Note that the items in the list are reported by Internet Explorer as separated
        by a comma <em>and a space</em>. This is important to bear in mind when trying to
        parse the list back out.)
    </p>
    <p>
        For both transitions and animations, the properties other than the lifetime property
        are <em>captured</em> at the moment the action becomes active. After the action
        becomes active, changes to properties other than the lifetime property are ignored.
        <em>This capture behavior is essential to our design.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        The W3C specifies that script-applied actions become active when the style is resolved.
        (Earlier versions of the specification were unclear.) See <span class="ref">Resolving
            styles</span> for further discussion of style resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our overall algorithm for applying actions is as follows. Detailed discussion of
        each step follows the outline.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remember the pre-existing values of the action properties set by the application.
            <li>Set the shorthand action property to a comma-separated list of values for that action.
                If there are existing actions, the new actions are <em>appended</em> to the existing
                lifetime property.
                <li>Restore all the properties to their original values, except for the lifetime property.
                    <li>As each action completes, remove it from the comma-separated list in the lifetime
                        property and clean up.
                        <li>
        If the completion event has not fired by the time it was expected, a watchdog timeout
        ensures that we do not leave the Promise in a permanently-pending state.
    </ul>
    <p>
        It is important to append the new values to the existing properties, because the
        W3C says that in case of conflict, the last one wins. We set the new values via
        the shorthand property, because that solves multiple problems:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We avoid the need to count commas in the non-lifetime action properties. (If the
            individual action properties don't have the same number of commas as the action-lifetime
            property, then updating the existing values becomes trickier.)
            <li>
        We can set multiple properties with a single DOM call.
    </ul>
    <p>
        Note that you <em>cannot read the action shorthand property</em>: In the case where
        the non-lifetime action properties have the wrong number of commas, the shorthand
        property reads back as an empty string. (This behavior is required by the CSS specification.)
        Instead, we read the action-lifetime property and use just the names without any
        of the additional properties. This works because of the capture behavior described
        above: The parameters of the existing actions were already captured, so the values
        we provide here are irrelevant.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, consider the following properties. Observe that although there are
        two elements in the lifetime property, there are three in the duration (too many),
        only one in the timing-function (too few), and two in the delay property (just right).

        Suppose we want to start a <tt>"c"</tt> action with 100ms duration, linear timing,
        and 50ms delay. We first read the lifetime property, then append the shorthand description

style.lifetime = "a, b, c 100ms linear 50ms"

            Providing a name with no auxiliary properties is legal shorthand; it means that

            This actually does not cause a problem, because, as we noted, the action parameters
            are captured when the action is triggered, so the inconsistent values are of no
            consequence. As long as the names remain in the lifetime property, the original
            captured values will apply to the element.
        </p>
        <p>
            We restore the properties immediately after triggering the action to minimize disruption
            to the application.
        </p>
        <p>
            When removing transitions, we remove the <em>last matching item</em>, so that we
            do not accidentally damage any values set by the application, because we always
            append our values.
        </p>
        <p>
            For all actions, we listen on the completion event to know when that action has
            completed, and also create a watchdog timer to fire shortly after the expected completion
            of the action to handle the case where the action is abandoned without firing a
            completion. See <span class="ref">Watchdog timeouts</span> for further discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
            All actions register their presence in the
            <var>
                activeActions</var>
            array, which is an array indexed by the combination of the element's
            <var>
                uniqueID</var>
            and the the name of the property being animated. (Separated by a <code>|</code>,
            because that character is illegal in both IDs and property names, so it can safely
            be used as a separator.)
        </p>
        <p>
            An action registers with a callback function to call to cancel the action. This
            is done when a conflicting action is scheduled, so that the previous action can
            clean up and get out of the way before the new action starts modifying element properties.
            (Two actions are said to conflict if they attempt to animate the same property on
            the same element.) if the action is interrupted. See <span class="ref">Cancellation
                due to interruption</span> for further discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
            If an array of actions or an array of elements is passed, then each combination
            of action+element gets its own listener and watchdog. All the corresponding Promises
            are joined together to become the final Promise of the combined action. Using the
            <var>
                Promise.join</var>
            method allows us to simplify our logic by allowing us to focus on the one action
            + one element scenario.

        <h2>
            Forcing layout
        </h2>
        <p>
            In Internet Explorer, <span class="term">layout</span> is the act of applying the
            effects of all changes to the DOM that have taken place.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you change the DOM, such as inserting or deleting an element or changing an
            element property, Internet Explorer flags the DOM as "dirty". When control returns
            to the Internet Explorer event loop, Internet Explorer checks if the DOM is dirty,
            and if so, it performs a <span class="term">layout pass</span>, which takes all
            the changes and makes them take effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="term">Forcing layout</span> means forcing Internet Explorer to perform
            a layout pass outside of the event loop.
        </p>
        <p>
            The PVL needs a layout pass to take place after the DOM has been edited by the application
            so that the objects move to their final positions, at which point it can accurately
            calculate the distance the elements have moved.
        </p>
        <p>
            It turns out that Internet Explorer automatically forces layout if you try to read
            the
            <var>
                offsetTop</var>
            or
            <var>
                offsetLeft</var>
            properties when the layout is dirty. Therefore, we do not need to force layout explicitly;
            merely reading
            <var>
                offsetTop</var>
            and
            <var>
                offsetLeft</var>
            is enough to trigger layout.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Resolving styles
        </h2>
        <p>
            In Internet Explorer, styles are <span class="term">resolved</span> when the browser
            recognizes the value and takes action on it. Styles are resolved as part of the
            layout process, but you can also force styles to resolve outside of layout.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since action is taken only when styles are resolved, if you change a property multiple
            times in a row without an intervening style resolution, then only the final value
            will have any effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "intermediate writes are ignored" optimization does not cause a problem with
            most properties, but it affects transitions and animations because transitions and
            animations capture the values of properties at the point they are triggered, so
            we have to make sure the properties have the desired values at the point of triggering.
            If we update a property, then return without resolving styles, then it's possible
            that the property will change again before the next time styles are resolved (say,
            by another call to the PVL), resulting in the desired changes from the first animation
            not taking effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that the concept of style resolution is not part of the W3C CSS3 specification,
            which merely leaves to implementation free to decide what the requirements are for
            a change to a property to be counted as having taken place before, after, or simultaneous
            to another property change.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Internet Explorer, resolving any style on an element resolves all styles for
            that element, so we can combine multiple style-resolve operations into one if all
            of the modified styles apply to the same element.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Event handler gotchas</h2>
        <p>
            All event handlers are registered on the
            <var>
                document</var>
            rather than on the element itself, because an element whose
            <var>
                disabled</var>
            property is set to
            <var>
                true</var>
            does not receive events. Instead, the event bypasses the event and immediately bubbles
            to the parent.
        </p>
        <p>
            This quirk is not documented anywhere that I can find.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Watchdog timeouts</h2>
        <p>
            Both transitions and animations use watchdog timeouts to catch abandonment scenarios.
            The watchdog timeout is set to the expected end of the action, plus a little extra
            time to ensure that when the action completes normally, the completion event fires
            ahead of the watchdog.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scheduling the watchdog timeout is tricky because <code>setTimeout</code> starts
            the timer immediately, even though the animation timer doesn't start until the next
            render pass. (This is technically a violation of the CSS specification, which says
            that the timer begins at the time the style is changed.) If we had scheduled the
            watchdog timer with a normal <code>setTimeout</code>, then a long render pass (which
            can happen for complex animations) can result in the watchdog timer firing prematurely.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, we schedule the watchdog timer as a series of timeouts. The first timeout
            is for a fixed small amount of time. This guarantees that the first timeout will
            not expire until the first render pass is complete and the animation has started.
            At that point, we can schedule the real timeout, and this one will not fire prematurely.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Completion</h2>
        <p>
            Since we will sometimes cancel old actions while setting up new ones, we are careful
            to fulfill Promises asynchronously by calling <code>setImmediate(c)</code> rather
            than <code>c()</code>. Otherwise, the application's completion handler might try
            to schedule a third action while we are still trying to set up the second one, resulting
            in reentrancy and confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The exception to this rule is in the case where the Promise is being canceled (see
            below). In that case, we complete the Promise synchronously. This will not create
            reentrancy because the cancellation was initiated by the application in the first
            place. Any cancellations performed by the Animation Engine are done via internal
            mechanisms and are still completed asynchronously.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Cancellation</h2>
        <p>
            When you create a Promise, you can optionally pass a cancellation callback function
            which is invoked when the application invokes the
            <var>
                cancel</var>
            method on the Promise. Upon cancellation, the Promise enters the error state, and
            the error handler is called.
        </p>
        <p>
            Animations don't want to work that way. When the application invokes
            <var>
                Promise.cancel</var>, the animation should jump to its end state and complete
            immediately with success.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have confirmed with the base team that it is supported and designed behavior
            that if a cancellation function calls the completion callback before returning,
            then the Promise will enter the fulfilled state rather than the error state.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, whenever we create a Promise, we register a cancellation callback which
            cleans up the animation (thereby jumping to the end state) and <i>synchronously</i>
            invokes the cancellation function.

            Programmatic access to CSS styles</h3>
        <p>
            Styles on an element are stored in the <code>element.style</code> object, and calculated
            styles are obtained by calling <code>window.getComputedStyle</code>. There are three
            ways of accessing styles from these objects. Here they are with their relative cost,
            where indexing is normalized to have a cost of 1.

        <p>
            One theory is that calling <code>getAttribute</code> is slow because we end up making
            two calls into the DOM. First, we have to ask the DOM for the function pointer for
            the <code>getAttribute</code> method. Then we have to take that raw function pointer
            and convert it to a JavaScript function object. Those two steps together are already
            2&frac12; to 3&times; slower than indexing. Next, we have to call the JavaScript
            function object with the two parameters, which means unwrapping the object back
            into the raw function pointer. That last step takes 4&frac12; to 7&times; as long
            as indexing.
        </p>
        <p>
            At any rate, it's clear that indexing is the way to access attributes from style
            objects. Switching from
            <var>
                getAttribute</var>/<var>setAttribute</var>
            to indexing improved time-to-first-frame by 5%.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're going to be manipulating styles a lot, you should cache the <code>style</code>
            object in a local variable to avoid having to hit the DOM each time you type <code>element.style</code>.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Parsing transitions</h3>
        <p>
            The translation portion of a CSS transform matrix is in positions <code>e</code>
            and <code>f</code> in the <code>"matrix(a, b, c, d, e, f)"</code> value. (If there
            is no transform, then the string returned for
            <var>
                msTransform</var>
            is <code>"none"</code>.)
        </p>
        <p>
            The algorithm for extracting the <code>e</code> and <code>f</code> from the matrix
            string splits the string on commas, and if six fields are produced, it extracts
            fields 4 and 5 (counting from zero). There will not be six fields if the string
            is <code>"none"</code>, but in that case, the effective transform is the identity,
            so there is no translation. Note that we take advantage of the fact that
            <var>
                parseFloat</var>
            ignores trailing garbage, because field 5 will have a trailing close-parenthesis.
        </p>
        <p>
            You might think that a more efficient algorithm would be
        </p>
        <pre>
var matrix = new MSCSSMatrix(window.getComputedStyle(e).msTransform);
left += matrix.e;
top += matrix.f;
</pre>
        <p>
            It turns out that it's three times faster to do the parsing entirely in native JavaScript
            (which can be optimized) rather than calling into the DOM four times (once to construct
            the
            <var>
                MSCSSMatrix</var>, once to retrieve
            <var>
                e</var>, once to retrieve
            <var>
                f</var>, and once to destruct the matrix).
        </p>
        <h3>
            Bulk style updates</h3>
        <p>
            Multiple styles can be updated at once by appending to the <code>cssText</code>
            property:
        </p>
        <pre>
element.style.opacity = 1;
element.style.backgroundColor = "red";

// versus

element.style.cssText += "; opacity: 1; background-color: red";
</pre>
        <p>
            The leading semicolon is important so that the new CSS attributes are properly separated
            from the previous ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although this would appear to be an improvement since it reduces the number of round-trips
            to the DOM, no measureable improvement was observed in practice because of the cost
            of generating the original value of
            <var>
                cssText</var>. The benefit appears to be dependent on the complexity of the
            existing styles on the object.
        </p>
        <p>
            At any rate, we cannot use this technique even if it did provide an improvement
            because the Internet Explorer implementation of
            <var>
                cssText</var>
            does not properly return properties whose values contain an at-sign, semicolon,
            or quotation-mark. (The at-sign is used in font names to indicate that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2005/08/04/447759.aspx">
                the font is vertically-oriented</a>.) This bug in Internet Explorer is marked
            Won't Fix. Since we allow animations to be triggered on arbitrary application-provided
            elements, we cannot guarantee that the application's styles avoid the dangerous
            characters.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Shorthand properties</h3>
        <p>
            As noted in the opening discussion, shorthand properties are not reliable for reading,
            but they work just fine for writing. (Though there are problems if a name contains
            an escaped reserved character, but those problems existed even in the lifetime-property
            itself, so we're not introducing any new issues here.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Using shorthand properties for writing saves a number of round trips into the DOM.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Disabled elements</h3>
        <p>
            DOM events do not propagate to disabled elements. The AppBar control will sometimes
            animate disabled elements (for example, disabled buttons will animate into view).
        </p>
        <p>
            The workaround is to register the listener on the document root, which remains enabled.
            However, doing this unconditionally is expensive because it generates a lot of listener
            traffic which we end up just ignoring. Therefore, we move the registration to the
            document root only if the element is disabled.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the element is enabled at the time the action begins, but becomes disabled during
            the course of the action, then the DOM completion event will not be delivered to
            the listener. The watchdog timer catches this case and ensurse that the Promise
            completes eventually.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Cancellation due to interruption</h3>
        <p>
            It turns out that DOM events are expensive. Therefore, we avoid them whenever possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use the
            <var>
                activeActions</var>
            array to keep track of all the actions that we have scheduled which are still active.
            When an actions begins, it registers with the array, and when it completes, it unregisters.
            This is a native JavaScript object and therefore can be manipulated without going
            through the DOM.
        </p>
        <p>
            If during registration we see that there is already an active actions on the same
            element and property, we fire the completion of the old action before replacing
            its registration with the new action.
        </p>
        <p>
            By having our own table of active actions, we don't need to listen to the
            <var>
                MSTransitionStart</var>
            event to detect cancellation due to interruption: We fire the cancellation explicitly
            when the interrupting action is scheduled, rather than relying on the DOM event
            to notify us. (It also is important in the case of an interrupted Animation, because
            an interrupted animation does not fire an
            <var>
                animationend</var>
            event at all.)
        </p>
        <p>
            It also allows us to cancel actions on disabled elements. As noted above, native
            DOM events do not propagate to disabled elements.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Bottleneck</h3>
        <p>
            The bottleneck in the entire operation is the
            <var>
                setTemporaryStyles</var>
            function, which takes 46% of the total time. (20% of it is in the calculation of
            <var>
                prevStyles</var>
            and 20% is in the cleanup function. No other function comes anywhere close.) This
            makes sense since that function is where the bulk of the DOM manipulation takes
            place.
        </p>
        <h4>
            Miscellaneous failed optimizations</h4>
        <p>
            None of these optimizations led to measurable improvements.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Declare all properties in the same order. This means including dummy values for
                "keyframe", "property", "from" and "to" in the defValue. This is one of the JS perf
                recommendations on MSDN to improve hash table lookups, but the effect was not measurable.
                <li>Use countdown loop instead of count-up loop to avoid retrieving length repeatedly.
                    <li>Avoid unnecessary string concatenation. Change <code>(a ? a : "") + b</code> to
                        <code>(a ? (b ? a + b : a) : b)</code> which avoids the concatenation if a is null
                        or or b is <code>""</code>.
                        <li>Avoid map and build array directly.
                            <li>
            Set all properties for all elements, then resolve all styles, then restore all properties.
            This merely shifted costs; Internet Explorer did not observe any consolidation opportunities.
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Future optimization: The style cache</h3>
        <p>
            To avoid accessing the DOM, we can retain a private cache of what we think the DOM
            styles are and use that cache instead of accessing the DOM directly. The cache is
            obviously write-through, because we want our changes to take effect. A version of
            the library with this optimization is attached as "v1" to Windows 8 bug 820186.
            It appears to shave another frame off our time-to-first-frame, but the change was
            too risky to take at the point in the product cycle.

            Transitions
        </h1>
        <p>
            The responsibility for managing transitions is broken into two portions. The high-level
            <var>
                animations.js</var>
            file (the <span class="term">animation library</span>) deals with calculating the

                transitionAnimation.js</var>
            file (the <span class="term">animation engine</span>) deals with actually applying
            them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first part is an interaction between the application and the animation library.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The application calls
                <var>
                    create&shy;Xxx&shy;Animation</var>.
                <li>The animation library captures the current position of the element, then returns
                    to the application.
                    <li>The application alters the element position.
                        <li>The application calls
                            <var>
                                execute</var>.
                            <li>The animation library calculates the distance the element has moved. (This implicitly
                                forces layout.)
                                <li>The animation library applies a transform to the element which negates the position
                                    change performed by the application. (It does not need to resolve the style for
                                    reasons described in the section <span class="ref">Resolving the current style before
                                        animating</span>.)
                                    <li>

            transform.
        </ul>
        <p>
            The second part is handled by the low-level animation engine.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The animation engine resolves styles on the element for reasons described in the

                <li>The animation engine updates the transition-related properties on the element to
                    specify that changes to the transform should be applied smoothly rather than instantaneously.
                    <li>The animation engine removes the transform.
                        <li>The animation engine resolves styles on the element, so that the browser observes
                            the removal of the transform and begins the transition.
                            <li>The animation engine restores the transition properties now that they are no longer
                                needed.

                <li>The animation library captures the current position of the element (100), then returns
                    to the application.
                    <li>The application moves the element to position
                        <var>

                        = 300.
                        <li>The application calls
                            <var>
                                execute</var>.
                            <li>The animation library observes that the element moved 200 pixels to the right, and
                                applies a counteracting translation of
                                <var>
                                    translateX(-200px)</var>. This causes the object's visual to appear at position
                                100 (i.e., unchanged from where it was prior to the transition), even though its
                                position in the layout is 300.
                                <li>The animation engine adds a transition to the element specifying how the transform
                                    should be animated.
                                    <li>The animation engine removes the transform. Since a transition is active on the
                                        element, the transform animates smoothly from
                                        <var>
                                            translateX(-200px)</var>
                                        to
                                        <var>
                                            translateX(0)</var>. To the user, it appears as
            if the object moves smoothly from its old position to its new position.
        </ul>
        <p>
            The remainder of this section discusses the details of the algorithm.

        <h2>
            Capturing the current position of the element
        </h2>
        <p>
            The position of an element may be animating at the time the transition is applied.
            We must capture the in-flight value of the position.
        </p>
        <p>
            The current layout position can be obtained from the
            <var>
                offsetLeft</var>
            and
            <var>
                offsetTop</var>
            properties.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tricky part is that we also want to incorporate any translation transform that
            may be active on the element. To do this, we use
            <var>
                window.getComputedStyle(element).msTransform</var>
            and extract the x- and y- coordinates from the transformation matrix. Note that
            the in-flight position is relevant only when capturing the original positions. Final
            positions need to capture only the layout position, since we are going to be changing
            the transform ourselves.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Resolving the current style before animating
        </h2>
        <p>
            It is not well-known that the browser does not respond to a change in a CSS value
            until the style is resolved. (See <span class="ref">Resolving styles</span> above.)
            As a result, many developers will write code like this
        </p>
        <pre>
// incoming's initial opacity is 1.
// Set it to 0 so it will fade in.
incoming.style.opacity = 0;
WinJS.Animations.crossFade(incoming, outgoing);
</pre>
        <p>
            Unless special action is taken, this code will not actually animate from opacity
            0 to 1, because the starting opacity of 0 was never resolved before the animation
            engine changed it to 1. As a result, the browser will see that the opacity changed
            from 1 to 1 and perform no animation.
        </p>
        <p>
            To cover for this type of mistake, the animation library will automatically resolve
            the initial CSS property values so that the above code will work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since this workaround already is present, we may as well take advantage of it in
            the animation library: After applying the counteracting transform to each element
            that moved, we would normally resolve the style so that the initial transform is
            not animated, and so that it will be taken as the starting point of the animation.
            But we can skip that step and let the animation engine do the resolve.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Applying the initial transform without animation
        </h2>
        <p>
            When the animation library applies the initial counteracting transform, it does
            so without animation because our overall design removes the transition properties
            as soon as the transition begins. Therefore, there are no leftover transition properties
            that would cause the initial transform to be animated.
        </p>
        <p>
            After setting the initial transforms, we resolve the transform style so that the
            browser observes the initial value before we start enabling transitions.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Edge case for transitions
        </h2>
        <p>
            Transitions are triggered by <em>changes to</em> element properties. If the target
            element's property has a value equal to our desired transition target, then no transition
            takes place, and consequently, transition events do not fire.
        </p>
        <p>
            To protect against this case, we filter out transitions that have no effect and
            do not bother trying to apply them. That way, we don't register for events that
            will never fire.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that Internet Explorer returns values that may be different from the value
            used to set the property. Examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Setting the
                <var>
                    -ms-transform</var>
                to <tt>"translate(0.00,0)"</tt> reads back as <tt>"translate(0, 0)"</tt>. The trailing
                decimal places were removed, and a space was inserted after the comma.
                <li>Setting the
                    <var>
                        -ms-transform</var>
                    to <tt>"scale(.50,.50)"</tt> reads back as <tt>"scale(0.5)"</tt>. A leading zero
                    was inserted, the trailing decimal places were removed, and since the X-scale and
                    Y-scale are the same, they were collapsed into the shorthand notation.
                    <li>Setting the
                        <var>
                            opacity</var>
                        to <tt>"0.999999999999999999999999"</tt> reads back as <tt>"1"</tt>.
        </ul>
        <p>
            Internet Explorer is inconsistent as to whether changes to equivalent values are
            considered changes for the purpose of triggering transitions. In the above examples,
            changing the
            <var>
                -ms-transform</var>
            to an equivalent translation <em>does</em> trigger a transition, whereas the change
            the equivalent
            <var>
                opacity</var>
            does <em>not</em> trigger a transition.
        </p>
        <p>
            To avoid surprises, we ask Internet Explorer to munge the value so we can see how
            it looks after it has been internalized and spit back out. To do this, we create
            a temporary element (never added to the document, so it does not trigger layout)
            and set the property on the temporary element, then read it back, and use that result
            as the "canonical form" for the property value. (If for some reason, Internet Explorer
            is inconsistent with its canonical forms, the watchdog timeout will save us.)
        </p>
        <h2>
            Interrupted transitions
        </h2>
        <p>
            If the animating property is modified, either by the application directly, or because
            the application requested a conflicting transition, no
            <var>
                transitionend</var>
            event is fired. From the browser's point of view, the transition is still in progress;
            it merely got redirected. The
            <var>
                transitionend</var>
            event fires only when the new transition completes.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the case where a conflicting action is requested by the application, we manually
            fire the cleanup callback so that the previous transition will clean up and get
            out of the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that if an application attempts to apply a transition to an element without
            using the animation engine, the animation engine will not detect the interruption.
            We do not consider this a primary scenario, since applications should be using the
            animation library for all animations. This will instead be treated as an Abandonment
            scenario.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Abandonment
        </h2>
        <p>
            For the purpose of this document, we shall use the term <span class="term">abandonment</span>
            to refer to situations in which the final
            <var>
                transitionend</var>
            event does not fire, and the interruption was not detected when the animation engine
            scheduled a conflicting action.

        <h3>
            Transition redirection
        </h3>
        <p>
            As we noted above, if a new value is set for the property undergoing transition,
            the existing transition is considered to have been <span class="term">redirected</span>.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Transition removal
        </h3>
        <p>
            According to the CSS3 Transition spec, section 5:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                In the case where a transition is removed before completion, such as if the transition-property
                is removed, then the [transitionend] event will not fire.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The example given refers to this scenario:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set
                <var>
                    -ms-transition-property</var>
                to <tt>"-ms-transform"</tt>.
                <li>Modify the
                    <var>
                        -ms-transform</var>
                    property, thereby triggering the transition.
                    <li>Set
                        <var>
                            -ms-transition-property</var>
                        to <tt>"opacity"</tt>.
        </ul>
        <p>
            The act of setting
            <var>
                -ms-transition-property</var>
            to <tt>"opacity"</tt> causes the transform transition to become abandoned, since
            <tt>"-ms-transform"</tt> is no longer set.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are careful never to remove properties from the
            <var>
                -ms-transition-property</var>
            that we did not put there ourselves. If there are multiple transitions on the same
            property, the property name appears twice in the list, so that removal of the old
            transition will still leave the property name in the list and not result in abandonment
            of the new transition. The only time this problem will occur is the application
            removed the transition.
        </p>
        <p>
            One way of detecting abandonment is to register a listener on all attribute changes,
            and detect that somebody has deleted <tt>"-ms-transform"</tt> from the
            <var>
                -ms-transition-property</var>
            attribute. We will not do this, however, because the problem is fixed by the more
            general solution below.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Element removal
        </h3>
        <p>
            Another case where transitions can become abandoned is if the element is removed
            from the document. There is a W3C DOM event
            <var>
                DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument</var>
            which fires when this occurs, but Internet Explorer does not support this event.
        </p>
        <h3>
            The watchdog timer
        </h3>
        <p>
            We handle transition abandonment generally by scheduling a timeout on the element
            which fires slightly after the anticipated completion of the transition. The timeout
            function completes the transition promise if it has not yet completed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The timeout is canceled as part of completion.

            Animations behave better with respect to interruptions than transitions. If an animation

                -ms-animation-name</var>

        <p>
            We protect against this the same way we protected against abandoned transitions:
            By creating a watchdog timeout that fires if the

                animationend</var>
            event did not fire as expected. When the watchdog timeout fires, we assume that

            the element's properties are controlled by their actual styles rather than the keyframe.
            This behavior can be altered by the standard-proposed
            <var>
                animation-fill-mode</var>
            property.

            The
            <var>
                animation-fill-mode</var>
            is a comma-separated list of values, each one applying respectively to the corresponding
            comma-separated keyframe name. Like the other animation properties, it is captured
            when the animation begins.
        </p>
        <p>
            This property permits us to let the animation "hold" the initial and final values
            outside of the keyframe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note, however, that the effect of the
            <var>
                animation-fill-mode</var>
            extends only as long as the animation remains applied to the element. This creates
            a problem for staggered animations, because each individual participant in the animation
            will complete at a different time, but the promise returned by the animation library
            does not fire until <em>all</em> participating elements have finished animating.
            Each individual participant does not know when the other participants will complete,
            so it will not know how long to delay clearing the keyframe. This gets particularly
            complicated when multiple animations are combined, since there is no way for a Promise
            to know that it has been joined or chained to another Promise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Solving this problem would require applications who compose animations (via chaining
            or joining) to communicate the "final completion" back into the animation engine
            so it can perform final cleanup. This is problematic, so we solve the problem by
            punting: If the application wants the object to retain its final property, it needs
            to set that property prior to triggering the animation.
        </p>
        <pre>
e.style.opacity = 0; // NEW
WinJS.UI.Animation.fadeOut(e).then(function() { e.parentNode.removeChild(e); });
</pre>
        <p>
            Although cumbersome, this approach does have the following advantages:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is consistent with the general principle that non-layout animations do not make
                permanent changes to element properties. (If you want a permanent change, you must
                make it yourself.)
                <li>It makes it possible to compose animations into a single storyboard.
                    <li>
            It avoids a breaking change from the animation library shipped at the 2011 //build/
            conference.
        </ul>

            <span class="bug">We may want to change
                <var>
                    fadeIn</var>
                and friends from animations to transitions, so that the final opacity sticks at
                the end rather than reverting. This does introduce a breaking change, but perhaps
                the scope of the break is not significant, since people are likely to expect the
                opacity to be updated anyway. </span>

            methods allow an application to influence whether the PVL performs animations. The
            <var>
                isAnimationEnabled</var>
            method allows an application to query whether the PVL will perform an animation.
            This allows an application to enable or disable its manual animations in sync with
            the PVL.

            Calling
            <var>

            increments the
            <var>

            <var>
                disableAnimations</var>
            decrements it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The PVL uses this algorithm to determine whether animations are performed:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with the
                <var>
                    enableCount</var>.
                <li>If animations are enabled by policy, then add 1. Otherwise, do not add 1.
                    <li>
            If the result is greater than zero, then animations are performed.
        </ul>
        <p>
            This model permits the following usage patterns:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>doStuff();</code><br>
                If the application never disables or enables animations, then animations occur based
                on policy.
                <li><code>enableAnimations(); alwaysAnimates(); disableAnimations();</code><br>
                    If the application explicitly enables animations, then animations are enabled regardless
                    of policy.
                    <li><code>disableAnimations(); neverAnimates(); enableAnimations();</code><br>
            If the application explicitly disables animations, then animations are disabled
            regardless of policy.
        </ul>

                Any member of the Animation or Transition object can be set to a function rather
                than a fixed value. In that case, the function is called for each element, and its
                return value is used as the corresponding value of the Animation or Transition for
                that element. Using a function allows a caller to provide a different action for
                each element. For example, this technique is used to implement stagger animations,
                and to allow animating objects to move to different final positions.

                which matches the keyframe, so that action conflicts can be detected and dealt with.

                The animation engine creates copies of the Animation object for capture purposes,
                so that changes made by the calling application to the Animation object do not interfere
                with our callbacks, and so that we can attach private information to the copy. (Earlier
                versions of the animation engine modified the Animation object, which caused problems
                if the application re-used the Animation object for multiple animations.)

            <p>
                After copying the Animation object (evaluating functions as necessary for dynamically
                properties), we add the following internal properties to our copy:

                As with Animation objects, the animation engine creates copies of the Transition
                object for capture purposes as part of the evaluation. Otherwise, if the application
                modified the

                    We create private copies of the Transition objects so that we are insulated from
                    changes made by the application, and so that we can evaluate any callback functions.

                <p>
                    If the transition has an explicit

                <p>
                    If the element is already at the target value, then there is no transition, and
                    the corresponding Transition object is filtered out.

                    The timeout associated with the
                    <var>
                        finish</var>
                    callback is set in two steps to ensure that the time-to-first-frame does not count
                    toward the timeout. We set the watchdog timeout to the expected completion time
                    <em>after</em> the first frame has completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final step is to update the value of the animating property to trigger the transition.
                    We do not resolve the style yet; we'll do that at the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that the loop over the transitions must be performed via
                    <var>
                        forEach</var>
                    rather than a
                    <var>
                        for</var>
                    loop, because we need each iteration to capture a different
                    <var>
                        transition</var>
                    local variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the final properties are set, we resolve one of the animating properties to
                    trigger them all. (The IE folks recommended this instead of triggering each transition
                    separately.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    After all transitions have been triggered, we can clean up the temporary styles,
                    since their values were captured at the time the transition was triggered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If animations are disabled (<var>animate</var>
                    is
                    <var>
                        false</var>), then all we do is set the final values of the transitions into
                    the element. No promise is generated since the operation completed synchronously.
                    To maintain semantic equivalence with the case where animations are enabled, we
                    also resolve the style after setting the final values, just like we would have if
                    animating.

                    The timeout associated with the
                    <var>
                        finish</var>
                    callback is set in two steps to ensure that the time-to-first-frame does not count
                    toward the timeout. We set the watchdog timeout to the expected completion time
                    <em>after</em> the first frame has completed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that the loop over the animations must be performed via
                    <var>
                        forEach</var>
                    rather than a
                    <var>
                        for</var>
                    loop, because we need each iteration to capture a different
                    <var>
                        anim</var>
                    local variable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After all the keyframes and events are hooked up, we see if any of the keyframes
                    being scheduled match a keyframe that we canceled. If so, then the application is
                    restarting a keyframe animation, so we must force a style resolution so that the
                    browser will stop the previous keyframe animation. (If we did not do this, then
                    the browser would not notice that we deleted and re-added the same keyframe animation;
                    it would see that nothing changed, and the effect would be that the new keyframe
                    animation just continues where the previous keyframe animation left off.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that the restart detection code assumes that the array of animations passed
                    by the application does not attempt to animate the same property multiple times.
                    (Our restart detector merely compares the previous against the next, rather than
                    previous against all subsequent.) This is a reasonable assumption because attempting
                    to animate the same property multiple times is pointless, since only the last animation
                    will survive. Since applications are not expected to generate the animation descriptors
                    at runtime, the duplicates would be removed at authoring time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, we apply the animation styles (which resolves the
                    <var>
                        -ms-animation-name</var>, thereby triggering the animations) and immediately
                    clean up the temporary styles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If animations are disabled (<var>animate</var>
                    is
                    <var>
                        false</var>), then we do nothing, since animations have no lasting effect. No
                    promise is generated since the operation completed synchronously.

                    The <code>try...catch</code> around the probe for WinRT is to protect against problems
                    that may occur if the Web page happens to have a global object named
                    <var>
                        Windows</var>. (Perfectly legal and not entirely unreasonable.) If that's the
                    case, we will take an exception when we try to invoke WinRT methods on it, since
                    it's not actually WinRT. If that happens, then we just say, "Forget it, we don't
                    have WinRT here." We perform early tests against
                    <var>
                        window.Windows</var>
                    and

                    when the application developer goes to debug their page. (Otherwise, they will see
                    this exception and think, "Maybe that's why my page isn't working.")

                    We use the algorithm described in <span class="ref">Globally enabling and disabling
                        the PVL</span> to determine whether animations are enabled. Note that we take
                    advantage of the fact that boolean
                    <var>
                        true</var>
                    has numeric value 1, whereas boolean
                    <var>
                        false</var>
                    has numeric value 0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the
                    <var>
                        execAction</var>
                    has been called on each animating element, we join together all the
                    <var>
                        Promise</var>s, forming the final
                    <var>
                        Promise</var>
                    for the action. If there are no promises to join (all operations completed synchronously),
                    we return a zero-duration timeout promise so that the promise completes asynchronously.
                    This preserves event-ordering behavior when animations are disabled.

                        If the application-provided offset flips in RTL, but we have only an LTR keyframe,

                        <var>
                            null</var>, because we need to know up front whether to pass a callback as the

                        If the application-provided offset does not flip in RTL, then we can apply the LTR
                        keyframe statically to all elements.

                    <p>
                        Otherwise, the application-provided offset flips in RTL (and therefore the default
                        offset also flips in RTL), so we can use
                        <var>
                            keyframeCallback</var>

                            "rtl"</var>, then the value is negated. (Note that our negation algorithm is
                        purely textual, and it ends up negating <tt>"0pt"</tt> to <tt>"-0pt"</tt>. Fortunately,
                        <tt>"-0pt"</tt> is still a legal CSS dimension, and it will be simplified to <tt>"0pt"</tt>
                        by the animation engine.
